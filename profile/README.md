# Portable Text

Portable Text is a JSON-based block content specification for modern content editing platforms. 

It is presentation-agnostic and can be extended with custom block types, styles, decorators, and annotations. It can be serialized and integrated natively into frameworks and has a rich ecosystem of supporting libraries.
